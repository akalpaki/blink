# Blink

Blink is a TUI wrapper around `curl` which aims to provide
and easy and comfortable way to utilize `curl` for API testing and more.

Idea: write a frontend for curl that can do cool stuff

Goals:
- Make curl easier to use (I don't want to remember and have to write 50 flags)
- Make output easier to read -> colors, try to make the TUI look cool
- Request storage/library? Sharable?
- Copy responses of your curls to clipboard for easier copy pasting?
